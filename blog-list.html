                    Have you ever needed to extract, validate, or compare data from API responses? Accurate validation is key when working with REST APIs. In RestAssured, one method to extract response data is using response.asString(), which converts the entire API response into a string. However, this approach has drawbacks—it treats everything, including numbers and objects, as strings, leading to potential validation issues.  
                    </p>

                     Hamcrest Matchers is a Java library that provides a flexible and readable way to write assertions, making it easier to match arrays, collections, numbers, strings, and other objects in tests. It is commonly used for unit testing and works well with JUnit, TestNG, and other testing frameworks.

                     Accessibility testing ensures that digital applications—websites, mobile apps, and software—are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. Disabilities may include visual impairments, hearing loss, mobility challenges, cognitive disabilities, and more. By adhering to standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), accessibility testing helps create inclusive experiences for all users.

                     A test framework is a set of guidelines, tools, and best practices designed to facilitate the automated testing of software applications. It provides a foundation for creating and managing test scripts, ensuring consistency, reusability, and scalability. A well-constructed framework minimizes redundancy, enhances collaboration, and ensures that testing aligns with development goals.

                       Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Data-Driven Testing (DDT) are two distinct testing methodologies, each with unique goals, processes, and use cases. While both are vital in ensuring software quality, they address different aspects of testing and cater to different project needs.
