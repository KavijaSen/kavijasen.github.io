        <p>Have you ever needed to extract, validate, or compare data from API responses? Accurate validation is key when working with REST APIs. In <strong>RestAssured</strong>, one method to extract response data is using response.asString(), which converts the entire API response into a string. However, this approach has drawbacks—it treats everything, including numbers and objects, as strings, leading to potential validation issues. A better alternative is <strong>JsonPath</strong>, which extracts values while preserving their actual data types, making validation more accurate and reliable.</p>
        
        <p>Let’s see an example API response:</p>
		<p>You can see below an API response that consists of nested objects and key-value pairs. It includes basic details like id, email, username, and phone, along with nested objects such as name (containing firstname and lastname) and address (with city, street, zipcode, and geolocation). This response contains data of different types, not just strings, such as integers and nested objects, providing a rich structure for representing complex user information.</p>
       
      <code>   {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "username": "johndoe",
    "password": "password123",
    "name": {
        "firstname": "John",
        "lastname": "Doe"
    },
    "address": {
        "city": "New York",
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "number": 1,
        "zipcode": "10001",
        "geolocation": {
            "lat": "40.7128",
            "long": "-74.0060"
        }
    },
    "phone": "123-456-7890"
}         </code>

        <br>
        <p>If we use asString() to convert the entire API response into a string and attempt to extract or compare the content, we may run into challenges. As you have already seen, the API response contains a mix of data types, including strings, integers, and nested objects. Converting the entire response into a string loses the structure of the data, making it difficult to accurately extract or compare specific values, 
		especially when dealing with nested fields. This approach is not ideal for validating or working with complex, structured API responses.</p>
		<p>Here’s an example of how asString() can be used to convert an API response into a string:</p>
        <br>
        <code> public class JSONpathTests {

    private static final String STORE_USER_URL = "https://fakestoreapi.com/users/{id}";

    @Test
    public void testStringResponse() {
        Response response = RestAssured
                .given()
                .pathParam("id", 1)
                .when()
                .get(STORE_USER_URL);

        // Convert response to a string
        String responseBodyString = response.asString();
        System.out.println("Response as String: " + responseBodyString);

        // Check if "address" exists
        assertThat(responseBodyString.contains("address"), equalTo(true));
    }
}          </code>

        <br>
        <h3>Why This Is a Problem:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>asString()<strong>converts everything to a string</strong>, making validation tricky.</li>
            <li>Numbers like "number":1 are treated as strings, causing type mismatches.</li>
            <li>Extracting nested objects manually is <strong>error-prone</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Now, let’s look at how JsonPath can help us handle this situation more effectively. Unlike asString(), which converts the entire response into a plain string, JsonPath allows us to navigate the structured data and extract specific values, even from nested objects. This makes it easier to validate and compare specific parts of the API response.</p>
        <p>Here’s an example of how you can use JsonPath to extract specific fields from the response:</p>
        <h3>Code Demonstration</h3>
        <br>
        <code> public class JSONpathTests {

    private static final String STORE_USER_URL = "https://fakestoreapi.com/users/{id}";

    @Test
    public void testJsonPathResponse() {
        Response response = RestAssured
                .given()
                .pathParam("id", 1)
                .when()
                .get(STORE_USER_URL);

        // Using JsonPath to extract the address
        JsonPath jsonPath = response.jsonPath();
        Object address = jsonPath.get("address");
        System.out.println("Extracted Address using JsonPath: " + address);

        // Validation
        assertThat(address, notNullValue());
    }
}          </code>

        <br>
        <h3>Why JsonPath Is Better</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Extracts values in <strong>their actual types</strong> (String, Integer, Object, etc.).</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to <strong>access nested objects</strong>.</li>
            <li>Allows <strong>type-safe validation</strong>.</li>
            <li>More <strong>readable</strong> and <strong>maintainable</strong> than handling raw strings.</li>
        </ul>
