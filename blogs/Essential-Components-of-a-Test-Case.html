            <p>In software testing, test cases are the foundation of ensuring that an application or system works as expected. Test cases provide a detailed guide to testers on how to verify the functionality of the application. A well-written test case helps not only in validating the system but also ensures consistency, repeatability, and reliability of the tests.</p>
            <p>Here’s a breakdown of the key elements that should be included in a test case:</p>
            
            <h2>1. Test Case ID</h2>
            <p>The unique identifier for each test case ensures it can be easily referenced. This ID often follows a standard format to help categorize test cases, especially when there are multiple sets of tests to manage. <br>
			<strong>Example: TC_001</strong></p>

            
            <h2>2. Test Case Title/Description</h2>
            <p>The title or description gives a brief summary of the functionality being tested. It should be clear and concise, explaining the feature or scenario being tested.</p>
			
			
			<h2>3. Test Objective</h2>
            <p>This section outlines the specific goal of the test case. It highlights what the test intends to validate or check.</p>
			
			
			<h2>4. Preconditions</h2>
            <p>Preconditions are the specific conditions or setup that must be in place before executing the test case. This might include user permissions, a specific environment configuration, or certain data setup.</p>
			
			
			<h2>5. Test Steps</h2>
            <p>Test steps outline the specific actions or interactions that need to be carried out during the test. This is the sequence of activities that the tester must follow to perform the test. These should be clear and precise.</p>
			
			
			<h2>6. Test Data</h2>
            <p>Test data refers to the input values needed for the test. It’s crucial to specify the data that will be used to validate the test, especially when testing user inputs, form fields, or database interactions.</p>
			
			
			
			<h2>7. Expected Results</h2>
            <p>Expected results outline the anticipated outcome of the test based on the input data. This helps in verifying if the system is functioning correctly by comparing the actual results with the expected ones.</p>
			
			
			
			<h2>8. Actual Results</h2>
            <p>Once the test is executed, the actual result is recorded. This section helps track the behavior of the system during the test execution. If the actual result matches the expected result, the test is considered passed; otherwise, it’s failed.</p>
			
			
			
			<h2>9. Postconditions</h2>
            <p>Postconditions describe the state of the system after the test case execution. It ensures that no unintended side effects occurred due to the test execution and the system is left in an expected state.</p>
			
			
			<h2>10. Status (Pass/Fail)</h2>
            <p>After executing the test case, the status indicates whether the test case passed or failed based on the comparison of expected and actual results.</p>
			
			
			<h2>11. Severity and Priority</h2>
            <p>Severity refers to the impact level of a defect found during the test, while priority indicates how soon the issue needs to be addressed. These elements are particularly important when defects are found during the test execution.</p>
			
			
			<h2>12. Comments</h2>
            <p>Any additional notes or observations can be added in this section. It might include issues encountered during testing or recommendations for future testing.</p>
			
			
			<h2>Best Practices for Writing Test Cases</h2>
            <p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Be Clear and Concise:</strong> Ensure that each step is easy to understand and execute. Avoid ambiguity, which can lead to misinterpretation.</i>
			<li><strong>Ensure Reproducibility: </strong>Test cases should be repeatable with the same outcome each time they are executed.</i>
			<li><strong>Consider Different Scenarios:</strong>Test cases should cover both positive and negative scenarios, including edge cases.</i>
			<li><strong>Incorporate Variability: </strong>Use different types of test data to ensure that the system can handle different input types or situations.</i>
			</p>
